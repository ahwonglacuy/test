    <p>I have a strong interest in computer science, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction, driven by my curiosity and passion for learning how technology can improve lives. 
	I enjoy exploring real-world problems through coding and research projects, and Iâ€™m particularly drawn to opportunities that allow me to collaborate, analyze data, and innovate.
	My interests also extend to writing and community volunteering, which help me stay creative and engaged outside the classroom.</p>
